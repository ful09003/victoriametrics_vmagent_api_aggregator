# Contributing

I welcome any and all feedback, suggestions, etc. for this library.
Beware using this for real in your environment :) I'd certainly not consider it production-quality, and it is
very much a pet project which I'll probably stop work on eventually anyways...

This code base should not build out end-user functionality by itself, though I would welcome PRs which also
include a quick-n-dirty example app like the existing main.go.
